Intro
-----
Smashcoin is a free open source project derived from Peercoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/smashcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/smashcoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/smashcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/smashcoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 3911 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Smashcoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the smashcoin network.
